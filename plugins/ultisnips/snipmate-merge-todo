- sample php
  if<tab> yields\
  if (CURSOR)
      code

  now I want to use a snippet like nin (not is_null($1)) at CURSOR, then
  continue at code, how do I do this?

- run the test suite

- uniq var names!

- colorize placeholders:
   1st red
  2nd green
  3rd ..
  
  Then you know ahead of time where the cursor will jump to.

- create a list about what is new to Snipmate users.
  Eg try
  bbox<tab> to get a fealing

- extract pieces such as  (long term)
  - markers
  - select python, talk to python
  - ...

- think about how to extract tcomment's filetype detection
  so that you get js completion in haml files in js sections etc.

  Rather rewrrite and start a new plugin

- snipmate will not be turned into something it isn't, so don't touch it.

- think about how to keep the feature that snippets can be patched and
  duplicated so that versions with and without markers can be used without
  redundancy

- wait for Holger Rapp to split snippets into its own repository, so that that
  can be merged with snipmate-snippets

- tell the mailinglist about this snippet community merge

- think about refactoring plugin/* beacuse that directory should only
  contain code which get loaded on each startup. It should only contain the
  interface declaration. Everything else should be moved to autoload or such

- think about whether to keep the plugin already sourced guard.
  It always annoys me.

- bzr ? there is an official mirror of a launchpad repo on github?
  doc/UltiSnips.txt says bzr? That's confusing. Consider updating the list of
  repos which is available

- priorities. collisions? Which is the correct way to handle them?
  There is ! modifier, good!

- escaping $ etc will work. Great :) snipmate failed on that

- nested snippets

- ${VISUAL}: great :-)

- what about xtemplate's completion feature stuff: eg input type for form
  elements? Does this work?

- Can a snippet reference others?

- implement Snipmates completion feature if you type only some chars such as
  bb<tab> should display all snippets startingh with bb ?

- think about what todo with extends feature. See change implementation

- the <tab> completion triggers completion popup is missing. Probbably getting
  this working is little bit more work ..

==== plugin/snipMate_compatibility.vim
	If people use it they should be using teir own code or put this into their .vimrc
	If they want to pollute the global namespace with a Filename word, then
	its should be them doing so.
	We don't want to keep cruft
