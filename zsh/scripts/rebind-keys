# The -e in the shebang line is a rather rude hack to avoid getting this run
# more than once and still be able to execute it from zshrc. With lock removed
# an exception is thrown, when the script encounters this line again...

# Caps lock to left control
xm 'remove lock = Caps_Lock'
xm 'keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L'
xm 'add control = Control_L'

# Left control is also Escape
xc 'Control_L=Escape'

# Avoid Shift-0 and Shift-9
xc 'Shift_L=parenleft'
xc 'Shift_R=parenright'

# Easier return, triggered by the thumb
xc 'Alt_R=Return'

# Could try something with backspace too?
